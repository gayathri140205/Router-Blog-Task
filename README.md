# React + Vite

I've recently crafted a website using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. 
This technology allowed me to create a dynamic and responsive website with efficient
rendering and seamless user interactions.
Overall, the utilization of React has not only enhanced the website's 
functionality but also facilitated a more maintainable and scalable codebase.
